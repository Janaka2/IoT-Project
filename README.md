# IoT-Project
# Smart Home Controller

## Overview
This IoT project is a smart home controller system that enables users to manage their home appliances and devices remotely. It uses a Raspberry Pi and various sensors to gather data, control devices, and provide a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Temperature, humidity, and light sensors
- Appliance control (lights, fans, etc.)
- Energy consumption monitoring
- Remote access via mobile app or web interface
- Voice control integration (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant)

## Technologies
- Raspberry Pi
- Python
- Node.js
- React
- MQTT protocol

## Setup and Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your Raspberry Pi with sensors and devices (refer to the hardware_setup.md file)
3. Install dependencies and run the backend: `npm install` and `npm start`
4. Install the frontend app on your mobile device or access it through a browser

## Fun Fact
I started this project to automate my own home and have since helped friends and family set up their own smart home systems.
